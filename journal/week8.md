Reflection:
Week 8 was extremely difficult. I had issues with the Presigned URL functionality which finally got fixed. 
Part of the issue at first was updating Andrew's profile which wouldn't work since it's his profile. Then I changed it to my actual profile alias, and that minimized the errors. The other part was I had to change the Origin header because a new instance of Gitpod would be created, so that Lambda had to be updated with the new Gitpod URL. 

Cloudfront was fairly easy to configure since I've used it before, but this was a different configuration to what I'm used to which is usually Cloudfront with S3 bucket with static React files.
