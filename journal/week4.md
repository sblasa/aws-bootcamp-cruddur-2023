# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Postgres 
I created the scripts for Postgres. I was trying to locate all the bash shell scripts I needed, but I missed a few, so the seeding of the database wasn't working properly at first. 

There were some issues connecting to RDS database at first because I didn't put the correct environment variable for the production connection string. 
Lambda trigger to insert user worked--eventually.

Disregard the funny messages. lol
