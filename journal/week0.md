This link contains both the conceptual and logical diagrams, the logical is on the next page within the document.

I thought it was pretty cool that the AWS icons were available in LucidChart. Also, I didn't realize that there were different versions of the AWS images, and some were older than the others, so I'll make sure I use the most current my presentations which concern AWS.

Also, I don't know too much about SVGs, so that explanation about it was helpful. I didn't know you could do that--save it as a file, and then import it somewhere. 

## Install AWS CLI

I was able to install AWS CLI in Gitpod. At first, I came across an error, but I saw in the instructional video showed how to fix the error. I used that information to fix the error.

Okay, so I got distracted by other things (life), and so my gitpod workspace would time out, and then I had to finish reinstalling AWS CLI.
