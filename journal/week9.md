# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

Created CodeBuild Project and had to change a few configurations in there to get it working.

Removed the Webhook checkbox in CodeBuild since it was doing the build twice. I looked at Discord Channel to see if anyone else had that issue,and found a thread providing a solution.

Created a CodePipeline  with Source, Build, Deploy stages.

Changed the HealthCheck api to return version number.

Decided to implement the Rollbar again with Andrew's fix with Flask/Rollbar. It's working now; however, I had an issue with using g library and it woudln't output the rollbar/test endpoint properly. I used sessions instead and it worked properly. Perhaps in this instance it's better to use sessions? 

Reflection:

I didn't realize that reason why the deployment was taking a long time because it was also doing a health check for ALB. I was only checking for the services.
