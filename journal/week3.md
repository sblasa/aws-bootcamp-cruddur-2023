# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## React Authorization
I had fixed some of the issues ahead of the video because I saw the React error issues in the frontend logs. Also, I had changed the login information to email address instead of user name since we were getting that error initially. I had most of the React authentication running, but my verification code wasn't working. I recreated my user pool again and removed the username, so required was only email.
I added preferred_username and name as optional attributes. Then it worked after that.

Here's my logged in user screenshot.
