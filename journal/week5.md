# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

The database setup hindered me a few times since I had forgotten to run the bash script each time I started a new environment on gitpod. It was a challenge to fully understand the queries for DynamoDB since I'm used to using SQL queries to query the database.

Trying to understand the relationship with my RDS and DynamoDB was confusing at first because I thought the data would just be inserted into the DynamoDB tables directly. Creating the pattern streams was a bit confusing too because trying to figure out how it works and what data we need to output or return. 

At some point, I inadvertantly posted my account when I was creating the policy for the message create lambda; however, I looked at Andrew's YouTube video on how to use the BFG repo cleaner, and it removed that information from my commit history. No screenshots for this journal since I was stuck a few times, and I forgot to document the issues along the way.
