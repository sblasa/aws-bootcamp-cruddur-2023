# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Implemented Honeycomb.IO Telemetry
- I had signed up for Honeycomb.IO. I didn't see the option for bootcamp in dropdown, so I used some other category.
- When we were configuring Honeycomb.IO variables, I wasn't sure if we were supposed to use set the environment variable HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur", or use it in my docker compose file and set it as OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "backend-flask", as Andrew did in his week 2 video. Jessica had mentioned that it was better to set it with a specific name in docker compose file to separate it out.
